## üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to set up DSCPL on your computer:

1. **Clone the Repository** (or download the code):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dscpl.git
   cd dscpl
   ```

   *Note: Replace* `your-username` *with the actual repository owner, or download the ZIP file and extract it.*

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended): This keeps your project‚Äôs dependencies separate from other Python projects.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The app requires several Python libraries. Install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don‚Äôt have a `requirements.txt`, install these packages manually:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit langchain langchain_community langchain_huggingface faiss-cpu google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client icalendar pytz requests pandas
   ```

4. **Set Up Google Calendar API** (optional, for calendar integration):

   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Create a new project and enable the **Google Calendar API**.
   - Download the `credentials.json` file and place it in the project‚Äôs root folder.
   - Follow the prompts during the app‚Äôs first run to authenticate.

5. **Prepare Configuration**:

   - Ensure you have write permissions in the project folder for saving chat history, reminders, and progress.
   - No additional API keys are required for basic functionality, but you‚Äôll need a valid `Flic-Token` for video fetching (included in the code).

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues:

- **Streamlit doesn‚Äôt start**:

  - Ensure you‚Äôre in the correct directory and the virtual environment is active.
  - Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **Google Calendar integration fails**:

  - Verify that `credentials.json` is in the project folder.
  - Delete `token.json` and re-authenticate.
  - Ensure you‚Äôve enabled the Google Calendar API in Google Cloud Console.

- **Videos don‚Äôt load**:

  - Check your internet connection.
  - The API token may be invalid. Contact the repository owner for an updated `Flic-Token`.

- **Chat responses are slow**:

  - The AI model may be processing large histories. Try clearing `history.json` (back it up first).

- **Error messages**:

  - Read the error in the terminal or browser for clues.
  - Search the error online or open an issue for help.

For other issues, check the Issues page or ask for help.
